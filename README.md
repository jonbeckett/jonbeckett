Hi! I'm Jonathan Beckett.

I can variously be found working on software and web development in the daytime, and in my own time you might find me tinkering with my own projects, writing, running, watching terrible movies, or playing video games.

You can find me on the internet here - [https://bio.site/jonbeckett](https://bio.site/jonbeckett)
