Hi! I'm Jonathan Beckett.

I can variously be found working on software and web development in the daytime, and in my own time you might find me tinkering with Linux, playing retro video games, writing idiotic blog posts, listening to terrible music, and jumping down internet rabbit holes.

The easiest way to get in touch is always email:
